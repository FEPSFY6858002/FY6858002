    Particle accelerators have expanded their repertoire to include medical applications by utilising the inventions of cyclotrons and linear accelerators (linacs). They are essential in the process of producing radionuclides for diagnostic imaging. The main example being PET scans. This will be explored and expanded upon in this paper about the medical application of particle accelerators.

  <! Particle accelerators, initially with intentions of contributing to high-energy physics research have resulted to have multiple purpose including medical applications. Research into particle physics gives us a better understanding of the way particles behave and thus allows for new technologies to be developed towards contributing to currently unresolved or uncurable medical diseases. However, there are direct applications of particle accelerators for medical purposes.

Most have heard of the famous Large Hadron collider at CERN in Geneva and its purpose of physics research. This is currently the world’s most powerful particle accelerator; it works utilizing superconducting magnets to guide along with electric fields to accelerate the particles. However, this specific accelerator does not directly have a medical contribution.
Cyclotrons are the first circle-based particle accelerators which were invented in 1929 by Ernest Lawrence. They have two ‘Dees’ which are semi-circular electrodes with a gap in between. A magnetic field acts opposite to the direction of the path of the particles as they travel. This keeps the particles within the Dees by giving them a circular path. The electric field between the gaps accelerates the particles which come out from the centre. Accelerating the particles causes an increase in their radius until they leave the Dees. The two main types are positive and negative ion cyclotrons. The linac or linear particle accelerator utilises a different method to accelerate particles and in comparison to the cyclotrons it is linear. PET (positron emission tomography) scans require radiotracers to function, these radiotracers can be produced from cyclotrons. PET scans are utilised for diagnostic purposes which is an essential part in treatment. Radiotracers are imperative to detecting abnormalities, cyclotrons provide the radionuclides which allow the PET scan to work.
PET scans have saved many lives through supporting diagnoses, primarily when looking for any types of cancer. Recently it has been used to additionally diagnose Alzheimer’s. PET imaging works with positron decay to produce an image that doctors can interpret. They consist of a ring of detectors and “by back projecting the lines of response a density map is generated that reflects the distribution of the positron emitter” thus through calculations you are able to see inside the human body.
Through changing the number of protons and or neutrons in an atom you can produce radionuclides. By adding to the number of nuclides, this gives the nucleus a surplus of energy. If the energy at which an incoming particle collides with another is greater than the other particle’s binding energy, then the other particle will be ejected from the nucleus. Furthermore, by choosing specific target nuclei, the bombarding particle and its energy it allows for the possibility to produce a specific radionuclide. Summarised from reference 3. Radionuclides are used for radiotracers in which they provide an image to an organ or organ system within the human body without the need for surgery which has many complications. Whilst the radiotracers are radioactive, they are not ionising enough to cause any permanent damage to the body whilst within it. There are challenges that are faced by the nature of the PET scan since the positron is an antiparticle of the electron, when it comes into contact with an electron annihilation occurs. It is difficult to figure out the origin of the decay.>

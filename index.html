      Particle accelerators have expanded their repertoire to include medical applications by utilising the inventions of cyclotrons and linear accelerators (linacs). They are essential in the production of radionuclides for diagnostic imaging, with PET scans being a primary example. This paper explores the medical applications of particle accelerators, focusing on their transformative role in healthcare and diagnostics.

    <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Particle accelerators, initially designed for high-energy physics research, have found diverse applications, including medical uses. Research into particle physics has provided insights that enable technological advancements for addressing medical challenges. This paper delves into the history, types, and medical applications of particle accelerators, with a focus on their role in diagnostic imaging and therapy.

    <h3 id="History">History and Development</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Cyclotrons, invented in 1929 by Ernest Lawrence, were the first circular particle accelerators. They employ magnetic fields to guide particles in a circular path and electric fields to accelerate them. Linear accelerators (linacs), in contrast, accelerate particles in a straight line. These accelerators have evolved to support medical applications, such as the production of radionuclides for imaging techniques.

    <h3 id="Applications">Applications</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      PET scans, or positron emission tomography, rely on radiotracers produced by cyclotrons. These radiotracers enable the detection of abnormalities in the body, aiding in the diagnosis of diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. PET imaging uses positron decay to generate images, providing critical insights into the body's internal processes without invasive procedures.

    <h3 id="Challenges">Challenges</h3>
    <p class="indent">
      Despite their benefits, particle accelerators face challenges in medical applications. For instance, the annihilation of positrons and electrons during PET scans complicates the determination of decay origins. Additionally, the high costs and maintenance requirements of accelerators pose barriers to widespread adoption.
